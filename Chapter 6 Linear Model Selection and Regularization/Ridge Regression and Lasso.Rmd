Ridge Regression and the Lasso
================================

We will use the package `glmnet`, which does not use the model formula language, so we will set up on `x` and `y`:
```{r}
library(glmnet)
library(ISLR)
Hitters = na.omit(Hitters)
x = model.matrix(Salary~.-1, data = Hitters)
y = Hitters$Salary
```

First we will fit a ridge regression model. This is achieved by calling `glmnet` with `alpha=0` (see the helpfile). There is also a `clv.glmnet` function which will do the cross-validation for us.
```{r}
fit.ridge = glmnet(x, y, alpha=0)
plot(fit.ridge, xvar = "lambda", label=TRUE)
cv.ridge = cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha=0)
plot(cv.ridge)
```

Now we fit a lasso model; for this we use the default `alpha=1`.
```{r}
fit.lasso = glmnet(x, y)
plot(fit.lasso, xvar = "lambda", label=TRUE)
cv.lasso = cv.glmnet(x, y)
plot(cv.lasso)
coef(cv.lasso)
```

Suppose we want to use our earlier train/validation division to select the `lambda` for the lasso.
This is easy to do.
```{r}
set.seed(1)
train = sample(seq(263), 180, replace = FALSE)
lasso.tr = glmnet(x[train,], y[train])
lasso.tr
pred = predict(lasso.tr, x[-train,])
dim(pred)
rmse = sqrt(apply((y[-train]-pred)^2, 2, mean))
plot(log(lasso.tr$lambda), rmse, type="b", xlab="Log(lambda)")
lam.best = lasso.tr$lambda[order(rmse)[1]]
lam.best
coef(lasso.tr, s=lam.best)
```
